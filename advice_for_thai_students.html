							<h1 class="major">Advice for Thai Students on Studying Abroad</h1>
							<!-- <span class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->
							<p>So you like studying science in high school and you are looking to find a way to study abroad. 
								Your family does not have a mean to support a huge tuition in English-speaking countries and/or living expenses in the West. 
								What should you do? I was in this position ten years ago (ok, maybe eleven), and I made a decision based on my limited knowledge at the time. 
								With that experience, here are some of my advice. These only applies for natural sciences and perhaps engineering; I don't have knowledge about programs in humanities, social sciences, and the arts. 
								All of these are my personal opinion, of course.</p>
							<p>
								<b>Do NOT take Thai "Scholarship"</b> This may sound blunt, but please for the sake of yourself ten years down the line, do not sign away your future when you are 18.
								Sure, you might think that this is the easiest way to study abroad as all tuition and living expenses, which can total to well over 2 million baht a year, are paid for. 
								But truly this is a loan, and the payment is large. As a teenager, it is not possible to comprehend the opportunity cost involved with this scholarship. 
								You cannot know what opportunities will be available for you 10 years from now in Thailand. A lot of students who chose this path return home disappointed, not being able to use what they spend a decade studying in their research because of many obstacles. 
								Sure, a decade from now, it might be an amazing position opening for you in Thailand, but you simply do not know that. By NOT taking a loan from the Thai government to study abroad, you keep those choices yours. 
								This, of course, does not apply to King's scholarships and a few others that do not require you to return to work in Thailand for a decade or more. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Foreign Government Scholarships</b> For undergraduate studies, many other governments provide real scholarships (reads, no repayment). There are a few of these opportunities around; here are some well-known options:
								<ul>
									<li><a href="https://www.th.emb-japan.go.jp/itpr_th/jis_study.html">Japanese Government Scholarship</a></li>
									<li><a href="https://www.thaiembassy.sg/academics/students/%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B9%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%B6%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A9%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B3%E0%B8%AB%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%81%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%A2">Singaporean Government Scholarship</a>: also search for ASEAN scholarships from <a href="https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/scholarships/freshmen-international-students">NUS</a> and <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/undergraduate/scholarships/freshmen#Content_C010_Col01">Nanyang</a>
									The stipend is not going to be sufficient, so your family may still have to support you financially.</li>
								</ul>

							<p>
								<b>Graduate School Pays You</b> This is a key fact that many Thai students (including myself ten years ago) do not know: graduate programs in science are normally fully funded, meaning that your professor hires you as a teaching or research assistance, which pays for your tuition and salary. 
								In the US, you can expect at least $30,000 per year in salary in natural sciences. This is also the case in much of the West, including the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. I think this is also true for Japan and China. 
								This salary is signifacantly more than what you would get from the Thai government, and has no strings attached. You are essentially hired by your advisor to do research. This is very different from what is the case in Thailand and this is the single most important fact I want you to know.  
								In addition, there are also many graduate scholarships by various governments. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Applying for Graduate Schools in the US</b> The two most important things to have if you want to successfully apply for a graduate program in the US are research experience and good recommendation letters. 
								It is quite crucial to find a research project to work on as an undergraduate student. 
								If there is an opportunity to spend a summer working on a research project abroad, take it! This will immensely help with your application. 
								A typical application requires three recommendation letters. You should start thinking about who will write your letters in your third or fourth year of your undergraduate program. 
								These people are typically professors who know you well and people with whom you work on research project(s). 
								GRE scores used to be typically required, both the general test (reading, writing, and math) and subject test (physics, chemistry, etc.)
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Your Future, Your Choice</b> (Disclaimer: not an immigration advice) In the US, if you are admitted to a graduate program, you are eligible to apply for a student visa. 
								If your study is in science, technology, engineering, and math, you may be eligible to apply for up to 3 years of post-graduation employment in the US.
								After that, you will have an option to apply for a temporary work visa and/or an employment-based immigration visa (aka a green card). 
								International offices at universities usually provide resources and consultations on immigration matters. 
								And if after graduation, you decide that the US is not a right place for you, you still have a whole world of options for your future career, including returning home to Thailand.
